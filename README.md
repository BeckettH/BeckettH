Hey! I'm Beckett. My pronouns are they/them or he/him. Either is fine!

- I’m currently working on a couple projects.
The first is called CodeMapper and allows you to get a high-level overview of a project. It's ideal for projects with a lot of JavaScript at the moment and we're working to make the results just as useful if you have trouble seeing visualizations.
The second can be found at <a href="http://www.crushwhitesupremacy.com">www.crushwhitesupremacy.com</a> and is a quick way to find out what anti-racist action you can take with the specific amount of time or money you currently have available. At the moment it's mainly aimed towards white people but the goal is to expand the database of possible actions and customize things even more so that everyone can have useful suggestions offered to them.
- At the moment I'm playing with transpilers and Abstract Syntax Trees in Babel.
- I'd love to collaborate on projects with a focus on making the web more accessible to visually impaired and blind people.
- I’m looking for help with my anti-racist project. I have a LOT of actions that need to be tagged so the front-end knows who to offer them to.
